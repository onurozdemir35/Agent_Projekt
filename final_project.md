# üöÄ **Final Project: "Multimodal Market Analyst AI System"**

## üìå **Project Summary:**

Students will build a multimodal AI system capable of answering market-related queries, providing investment insights, analyzing historical market performance, generating forecasts, and visualizing financial data. The system consists of specialized collaborative agents coordinated by a central agent, using real-world financial data sourced exclusively from Investor Relations (IR) publications (PDF reports, slides, earnings call documents, etc.) for **Apple, Microsoft, Google, NVIDIA, and Meta** over the **past 5 years**.

---

## üñ•Ô∏è **System Overview & Agents' Roles**

The multi-agent framework includes clearly defined specialized agents:

### üåü **1. Multimodal Agentic RAG Specialist**

**Core Responsibility:**

* Handle multimodal financial queries (textual questions, financial tables, images/charts, PDFs).
* Retrieve relevant financial data specifically from IR documents of Apple, Microsoft, Google, NVIDIA, and Meta (past 5 years).
* Provide accurate and cited answers based explicitly on these sources.

**Capabilities & Tasks:**

* Multimodal embeddings generation (CLIP, SentenceTransformers).
* Document indexing and retrieval (FAISS, Chroma).
* Answer synthesis with explicit **citations**.

**Example User Query:**

> ‚ÄúSummarize NVIDIA‚Äôs recent financial performance based on this earnings presentation.‚Äù

**Example Output:**

> ‚ÄúNVIDIA‚Äôs Q4 FY24 revenue rose by 18%, driven by strong GPU sales (source: NVIDIA Q4 FY24 Earnings Slides, page 5).‚Äù

---

### üåü **2. Data Science & Analytics Agent**

**Core Responsibility:**

* Conduct advanced market analytics, trend analyses, and predictive modeling.
* Produce forecasts, explanatory insights, and visualizations.

**Capabilities & Tasks:**

* Extract structured data from IR documents (financial tables, earnings data).
* Forecasting and predictive modeling (stock-price forecasting with Prophet/ARIMA).
* Visualization creation (Matplotlib, Plotly).
* Generate explanatory textual insights for analytical findings.

**Example User Query:**

> ‚ÄúAnalyze Microsoft‚Äôs stock performance over the past year and forecast its performance next quarter.‚Äù

**Example Output:**

* Interactive stock-price visualization.
* A forecast for the next quarter with clearly presented confidence intervals and explanatory text.

---

### üåü **3. Web Search & Real-Time Market Agent**

**Core Responsibility:**

* Retrieve real-time market news, financial events, and current sentiment.
* Extract timely information from reputable online financial sources.

**Capabilities & Tasks:**

* Web scraping and real-time data retrieval (Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, NewsAPI).
* Summarize recent market sentiment and relevant updates clearly with citations.

**Example User Query:**

> ‚ÄúWhat's the latest news affecting Google‚Äôs stock price today?‚Äù

**Example Output:**

> "Google's stock rose 3% today, driven by positive market reactions to its latest AI product announcements (source: CNBC, May 2025)."

---

### üåü **4. Coordinator Agent**

**Core Responsibility:**

* Orchestrate complex queries, decompose tasks, and manage agent collaboration.
* Aggregate individual agent outputs into coherent, citation-rich summaries.

**Capabilities & Tasks:**

* Task decomposition and delegation (LangChain, GPT-based agents).
* Workflow coordination and response integration.

**Example Workflow:**

* Decompose multimodal query:

  * Retrieval and synthesis (RAG Agent).
  * Forecast and visualization generation (Data Science Agent).
  * Real-time sentiment and news retrieval (Web Search Agent).
* Aggregate results into unified, cited analysis.

---

### üåü **(Optional) 5. Quality Assurance & Ethical AI Reviewer**

**Core Responsibility:**

* Ensure accuracy, reliability, and ethical integrity of generated outputs.
* Validate factual correctness and appropriate citations.

**Capabilities & Tasks:**

* Automated moderation, bias checks, and fact verification.
* Ensure transparency, fairness, and ethical compliance.

---

## üé® **System Workflow (Example scenario):**

1. **User Query (multimodal input):**

   > "Based on these recent charts and current news, summarize Meta‚Äôs stock performance and predict its next-quarter outlook."

2. **Coordinator Agent:**

   * Parses query.
   * Assigns tasks to appropriate agents.

3. **Individual Agents respond:**

   * **RAG Agent:** Summarizes provided IR documents.
   * **Web Search Agent:** Retrieves latest market sentiment/news.
   * **Data Science Agent:** Generates stock-price predictions and visualizations.

4. **Coordinator Agent aggregates:**

   * Produces integrated, multimodal financial analysis with citations.

5. **(Optional) QA Agent:** Ensures answer quality, citations, and ethical compliance.


6. **Final Result:** Presented via a **Gradio UI deployed to Hugging Face Spaces**.
